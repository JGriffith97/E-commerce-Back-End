## Description

This project is designed to view and manipulate an E-Commerce website's backend database via NodeJS, mySQL, expressJS, Sequelize, and utilizes Insomnia.

---

## Installation

This application initializes via NodeJS and utilizes the npm modules present in the package.json. With the Node Package Manager (NPM), within the node console, simply type 'npm i' to install the necessary modules. This application also uses Insomnia to manipulate that database.

---

## Usage

First, from mySQL, source the schema.sql file present in ./Develop/db/schema.sql by typing 'SOURCE <pathToFile>/schema.sql'; this can also be done by opening a terminal within the /db/ directory and typing 'SOURCE schema.sql'; Once this is done, and with all the necessary npm modules installed, type 'npm run seed' to seed the database. Then type 'npm start' to initialize the application. The console should log that the server is now listening. Then from Insomnia, all routes specified in ./Develop/routes/ should function with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
